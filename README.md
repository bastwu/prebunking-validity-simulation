This is the GitHub Repository for my Bachelor Thesis "Analyzing Macrosocial Effects of Prebunking: Developing a Framework Considering Message Validity" which is based on the framework of [Klapproth, Unger, LÃ¼tke Stockdiek, et al.](https://github.com/mshunger/prebunking_HICSS/tree/main). <br>
The results directory contains all results of the simulation run, realized through the Python scripts [Agent.py](https://github.com/bastwu/prebunking_simulation/blob/main/Agent.py), [main.py](https://github.com/bastwu/prebunking_simulation/blob/main/main.py) and [runModel.py](https://github.com/bastwu/prebunking_simulation/blob/main/runModel.py). The plots in the figures directory were accomplished with the Jupyter Notebook [plots.jpynb](https://github.com/bastwu/prebunking_simulation/blob/main/plots.ipynb). <br>
<br>
This notebook also allows the output of plots with interactive sliders: <br>
